# QuantifAI


`quantifai` is a PyTorch-based open source radio interferometric imaging reconstruction package with scalable Bayesian uncertainty quantification relying on data-driven (learned) priors. This was used to produce the results of [Liaudat et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/0000.00000). The `quantifai` model relies on the data-driven convex regulariser from [Goujon et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12461).

In this code, we bypass the need of to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for Bayesian uncertainty quantification and we rely on convex accelerated optimisation algorithms. The `quantifai` package also includes MCMC algorithms for posterior sampling as they were used to validate our approach.

> [!NOTE]  
> This Python package is build on top of PyTorch, so all the computations can be accelerated considerably by using a GPU. 


## Installation

The `quantifai` package relies on the convex ridge regulariser CRR from [Goujon et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12461). The version used to generate the results from the Liaudat et al paper is the release `v0.1` from the fork [github.com/tobias-liaudat/convex_ridge_regularizers](https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/convex_ridge_regularizers).

We have not yet pushed the python package to PyPi, therefore, the easiest way to install `quantifai` is to start by cloning the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astro-informatics/QuantifAI
cd QuantifAI
```

Continue by creating a conda environment with all the requriments already specified in `environment.yml` as follows

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate quantifai_env
```

Finally, the `quantifai` package can be installed by running

```bash
pip install -e .
```


> [!NOTE]  
> In case the user does not want to create a conda environment, he can install the dependencies in the `environment.yml` file. The specific version of the convex ridge regulariser used can be manually installed by running
> ```bash
> pip install git+https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/convex_ridge_regularizers@v0.1
> ```


## Examples & usage

The easiest way to get into using `quantifai` is to check the different notebooks in the `example/` directory, which includes:

 - Compute MAP-based LCIs with the `QuantifAI` model ([Notebook](https://github.com/astro-informatics/QuantifAI/blob/main/examples/RI_imaging_QuantifAI_LCIs.ipynb)).
 - Compute MAP-based LCIs with the wavelet-based model ([Notebook](https://github.com/astro-informatics/QuantifAI/blob/main/examples/RI_imaging)).
 - Compute the MAP-based fast pixel uncertainty quantification method with `QuantifAI` ([Notebook](https://github.com/astro-informatics/QuantifAI/blob/main/examples/RI_imaging_QuantifAI_fast_pixel_UQ.ipynb)).
 - Compute a hypothesis test on an inpainted surrogate image with `QuantifAI` ([Notebook](https://github.com/astro-informatics/QuantifAI/blob/main/examples/RI_imaging_QuantifAI_hypothesis_test)).
 - Sample from the posterior distribution of the `QuantifAI` model using the SK-ROCK algorithm ([Pereyra et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1137/19M1283719)) and compare the results with sample-based LCIs ([Notebook](https://github.com/astro-informatics/QuantifAI/blob/main/examples/RI_imaging_QuantifAI_sampling)).


## Reproducibility

All the scripts and notebooks used to generate the plots of [Liaudat et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/0000.00000) can be found in the `paper/Liaudat2023/` directory and the data in the `data/` directory.

The most computationally intensive results of the paper can be obtained by running the two scripts in `paper/Liaudat2023/scripts/`, where `UQ_SKROCK_CRR.py` corresponds to the `QuantifAI` model and `UQ_SKROCK_wavelets.py` to the wavelet-based model. The rest of the results and plots can be generated by running the different notebooks in `paper/Liaudat2023/notebooks/`.
